to achieve Nash Equilibrium...
	each player must "know" the equilibrium strategy of every other player
	(all that really needs to be observed is how changing individual strategy affects payout)
		Process for individual player:
			0. start positive (change = 1)
			0. contribute a random percentage
			0. observe net gain/loss
			
			1. change contribution incrementally (increase if positive, decrease if negative)
			2. observe change in net gain/loss (netGain = return - contribution)
			3. adjust change (change *= netGain/netGain)
			4. repeat steps 1 - 3
